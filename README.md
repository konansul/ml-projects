# Machine Learning Projects – Theory and Practice

This repository is a structured collection of machine learning algorithms, organized into separate folders by algorithm. Each algorithm has its own folder, and each folder contains the following:
- The first notebook in each folder, (1.1, 2.1 and etc) introduces the algorithm, explaining the mathematical foundations, theoretical concepts, and implementation from scratch using Python. This serves as a learning resource for understanding the core principles behind the algorithm.
- Advanced – .ipynb, are notebooks that demonstrate the use of the algorithm in real-world or more complex scenarios. These notebooks often involve data preprocessing, model optimization, evaluation metrics, and visualization.

### Algorithms Covered
	•	Linear Regression
	•	Logistic Regression
	•	Support Vector Machines (SVM)
      •	K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)

The main goal of this repository is to provide clear and concise theoretical explanations of core ML algorithms and bridge the gap between theory and practice by applying algorithms on real datasets in advanced projects.

### Technologies Used
Python 3, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and other libraries used in advanced projects.
